## About
This repo and the result of it's code came out for my need to have the msitools availabe on the closed systems were I can't install packages due to lack of root access.

The "build_portable_msitools" script and the build action in this repo is using:
- [GNOME/msitools (readonly repo)](https://github.com/GNOME/msitools)
- [AppImageCrafters/appimage-builder](https://github.com/AppImageCrafters/appimage-builder)
- The msitools.png icon is used from [msi.png](https://www.softicons.com/system-icons/imageboard-filetype-icons-by-lopagof/file-msi-icon)

All the rights on used software and icon goes to their respective owners.
